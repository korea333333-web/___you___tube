Google Flow MCP is a local [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that lets an AI agent operate [Google Flow](https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow) through a user-owned Chromium session. It can discover the exact options available to each account, generate media with Flow subscription credits, wait for long-running jobs, use the upscale choices Flow actually offers, and save validated files directly into a project.

It does **not** require a Google generation API key. Credits are consumed through the Flow website just as they are when the user operates Flow manually.

> **Installing with an agent?** Tell it to read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and follow [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). The supported Antigravity command is `npm run setup:antigravity`. Installer agents must not modify source, install Playwright Chromium, generate tool schemas, or use an Antigravity scratch directory.

## Why Google Flow MCP

### The agent knows what the account can actually do

`flow_inspect_account` returns a live, normalized capability contract instead of relying on hardcoded assumptions:

- Image and video models, with stable IDs and the currently selected model
- Aspect ratios separated by media type
- Output counts separated by media type
- Selectable durations—only when Flow exposes a duration control
- Preview, original, available upscale, and unavailable/upgrade-only asset options
- Current Flow UI language and login state

Example from a real Spanish-language Flow account:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "image": [
      { "id": "nano-banana-pro", "label": "Nano Banana Pro", "selected": false },
      { "id": "nano-banana-2", "label": "Nano Banana 2", "selected": true },
      { "id": "nano-banana-2-lite", "label": "Nano Banana 2 Lite", "selected": false }
    ],
    "video": [
      { "id": "omni-flash", "label": "Omni Flash", "selected": true },
      { "id": "veo-3-1-lite", "label": "Veo 3.1 - Lite", "selected": false },
      { "id": "veo-3-1-fast", "label": "Veo 3.1 - Fast", "selected": false },
      { "id": "veo-3-1-quality", "label": "Veo 3.1 - Quality", "selected": false }
    ]
  },
  "aspectRatiosByMedia": {
    "image": ["16:9", "4:3", "1:1", "3:4", "9:16"],
    "video": ["16:9", "9:16"]
  },
  "outputCountsByMedia": {
    "image": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "video": [1, 2, 3, 4]
  },
  "visibleDurations": [],
  "availableUpscales": ["1080p"],
  "unavailableUpscales": ["4k"]
}
```

If Flow does not offer a requested model, ratio, duration, output count, or upscale, the MCP fails explicitly. It never silently substitutes a different paid option.

### Account connection without entering credentials again

The bundled **Flow Login Bridge** extension reuses Google accounts already signed into the user's normal Chromium profile. Connection is deliberately split into two MCP calls so the agent can explain each user action instead of disappearing into a long-running tool:

1. `flow_begin_account_connection` returns immediately and instructs the agent to stop and tell the user what to click.
2. The user clicks **Connect Flow** in the extension and replies **connected** after it says **Session sent**.
3. `flow_complete_account_connection` opens Google's existing-account chooser; the user clicks the desired account.
4. The actual Flow workspace is verified, the temporary window closes, and future automation uses an isolated persistent session.

No email entry, password entry, 2FA entry, cookie JSON, Chromium restart, or remote-debugging launch is required for the normal login path.

### End-to-end media delivery

- Generates video with Omni Flash or the Veo models exposed by the account
- Generates or edits images with the Nano Banana models exposed by the account
- Accepts prompts in any language
- Supports ratios, output counts, optional references, and durations when available
- Persists jobs that outlive an MCP request timeout
- Detects Flow's real asset-menu upscale choices, including resolution-based options such as `1080p`
- Captures browser downloads into an absolute project directory
- Correlates every download to the exact asset identities created by that job, independent of gallery order
- Downloads originals from the tracked Flow media URL, without relying on a visible gallery card or translated context menu
- Fails closed instead of guessing when Flow cannot expose a unique job-to-asset match
- Writes a `.flow.json` reproducibility manifest
- Records SHA-256 and file size for every download
- Adds duration, dimensions, codec, and format when `ffprobe` is installed
- Saves diagnostic screenshots when Flow's UI changes

### Designed for agents without hiding credit use

Generation and upscale tools require `confirmCreditSpend: true`. The agent should set it only after the user explicitly asks for a credit-consuming operation. Read-only inspection, status, and account-list tools do not spend credits.

Flow MCP also owns Flow's separate in-browser confirmation preference. Before submitting a generation, it opens the isolated managed profile's Agent settings, selects the language-independent `AUTO_APPROVE` value (shown as **Never** / **Nunca**), saves it, reopens the settings, and verifies that it persisted. If Flow still displays an approval card, the MCP selects the final persistent approval action—**Approve and don't ask again**—instead of leaving the agent waiting or choosing the one-time approval.

This does not bypass the MCP credit guard: a generation or upscale still runs only when the user requested it and the tool call includes `confirmCreditSpend: true`.

### Prevents browser-tool detours

The MCP publishes a server-level execution contract as part of the MCP initialization handshake and repeats the critical rules in every relevant tool description and response:

- Flow generation must use `flow_generate_video` or `flow_generate_image`
- Generic browser, computer-use, keyboard, mouse, and web tools must never operate the Flow website
- A generation has started only when a generation tool returns a persistent job ID
- A Google account avatar is not treated as proof that the Flow workspace is available
- The public Flow landing page is classified separately and causes an immediate `flow_access_unavailable` error
- Only a workspace-verified account can become the default or spend credits

This prevents an agent from scrolling around Flow's marketing site when the selected Google account is signed in but does not expose the generation workspace.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- Chromium or Google Chrome
- A Google account with access to Flow in a supported region
- Optional: `ffprobe` on `PATH` for richer media validation

### Install

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/retrolyze52/google-flow-mcp.git
cd google-flow-mcp
npm ci
npm run check
```

Playwright controls the locally installed Chromium/Chrome executable; it does not require a separate bundled browser download. **Do not run `npx playwright install chromium`.** Set `FLOW_MCP_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` to an absolute browser path only if auto-detection cannot find a normal system browser. See the complete [installation guide](INSTALL.md).

## Connect your Google account

### 1. Install the Flow Login Bridge once

The reviewed extension source is included in [`extension/`](extension/). It reads Google cookies only after the user clicks **Connect Flow** and sends them only to the MCP bridge bound to `127.0.0.1`. It never reads passwords or 2FA codes.

On Windows with Chromium:

```powershell
npm run install-extension
```

The helper copies the extension path and opens `chrome://extensions/`. Then:

1. Enable **Developer mode**.
2. Click **Load unpacked**.
3. Select the repository's `extension` directory.

For Chrome or another desktop platform, open `chrome://extensions/` manually and follow the same three steps. No browser restart is needed.

### 2. Start connection from the agent

Ask the agent:

> Connect my Google Flow account as `personal`.

The correct interaction is:

1. The agent calls `flow_begin_account_connection`, shows you its instructions, and stops.
2. Open **Flow Login Bridge** in the already-running normal browser and click **Connect Flow**.
3. When the popup says **Session sent**, return to the agent and reply **connected**.
4. The agent tells you a temporary chooser will open and calls `flow_complete_account_connection`.
5. Click one of the existing Google accounts shown in the temporary chooser.

That is the complete normal login flow. Completion is detected automatically and the temporary Flow window closes.

To connect additional accounts, repeat the process with IDs such as `studio` or `backup`. Each account receives an isolated persistent browser profile. Operations for one account are serialized; separate accounts can progress independently.

CLI equivalents are also available:

```powershell
npm run account -- connect personal "Personal Google Pro"
npm run account -- connect studio "Studio account"
npm run account -- list
```

### Advanced: attach to localhost CDP

If a browser was deliberately started with a localhost remote-debugging port, the MCP can attach without copying cookies:

```powershell
npm run account -- connect personal "Main Chromium" --cdp http://127.0.0.1:9222
```

Only localhost CDP endpoints are accepted, and attached browsers are never closed by the MCP. The extension flow is recommended for normal setup.

## Connect your MCP client

Run `npm run build` first. Replace the paths below with the absolute location of `dist/index.js`.

### OpenAI Codex

Add this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.google_flow]
command = "node"
args = ["C:\\absolute\\path\\to\\google-flow-mcp\\dist\\index.js"]
enabled = true
startup_timeout_sec = 30
tool_timeout_sec = 1200

[mcp_servers.google_flow.env]
FLOW_MCP_HEADLESS = "0"
```

Open a new Codex task after changing MCP configuration. This does not restart Chromium or require another Google login.

### Google Antigravity

Antigravity 2.0, Antigravity IDE, and Antigravity CLI support local stdio MCP servers. Clone into a stable directory—not Antigravity's disposable `scratch` directory—then run the supported installer:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/retrolyze52/google-flow-mcp.git "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\google-flow-mcp"
Set-Location "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\google-flow-mcp"
npm run setup:antigravity
```

The installer enforces a clean source tree, runs all checks, detects a normal browser, preserves unrelated MCP servers, backs up the existing config, and writes the official `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json` stdio structure with absolute `command`, `args`, and `cwd` paths. Then open **Settings → Customizations → Installed MCP Servers** and click **Refresh**. Antigravity discovers schemas automatically; do not generate them. This refresh does not restart Chromium or lose connected Flow accounts. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) and Google's official [Antigravity MCP documentation](https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp).

### Other stdio MCP clients

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-flow": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/google-flow-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example agent requests

Once the account is connected, users can speak normally:

> Inspect my Flow account and tell me exactly which image models, video models, ratios, durations, output counts, and upscales are available.

> Use Omni Flash to create one 16:9 video of a translucent glass jellyfish floating through a rainy neon city. Download it into `public/generated/flow`. Do not upscale it.

> Generate a vertical image with Nano Banana 2 Lite using the attached reference image and save it for my Remotion project.

> Upscale the last video to the highest resolution my account actually offers. Do not choose an unavailable or upgrade-only option.

The expected agent workflow is:

1. `flow_help` when the user asks what the MCP can do
2. `flow_list_accounts`
3. `flow_begin_account_connection`, user instructions, and a hard stop when connection is needed
4. `flow_complete_account_connection` only after the user confirms the extension click
5. `flow_inspect_account` immediately before generation
6. `flow_generate_video` or `flow_generate_image` after explicit authorization
7. `flow_job_status` for long-running work
8. `flow_upscale_video` when requested
9. `flow_download_job` for a ready asset that has not yet been downloaded

`flow_list_accounts` returns `connectionStatus`, `connectedAccountIds`, `defaultAccountId`, and an explicit next action. After a successful connection, that account automatically becomes the verified default. Generation and inspection calls may omit `accountId` to use it; provide an ID only when the user deliberately selects another connected account.

### Exact job-to-asset downloads

Flow may insert a newly generated asset anywhere in the project gallery; DOM order is not a creation timestamp. Google Flow MCP snapshots the existing asset identities before submitting a prompt, records only the identities that appear for that job, and uses those same identities for later upscale and download actions. It never substitutes “the last video” or “the latest visible image.” If the tracked identity disappears or becomes ambiguous after a Flow UI/session change, the operation stops with `generated_asset_not_found` instead of downloading a different asset.

Flow often keeps completed gallery videos hidden or off-screen without loading HTML video metadata. Readiness is therefore verified against the exact generated media URL, and original downloads use that same authenticated URL directly. Generation tools wait at most 20 seconds after submission; if Flow is still queued, they return `processing` with a persistent job ID. The agent must poll that same ID—never submit the prompt again.

Example video tool input:

```json
{
  "prompt": "A cinematic tracking shot through a rainy miniature neon city, shallow depth of field, reflections on wet streets, no text",
  "model": "omni-flash",
  "aspectRatio": "16:9",
  "outputs": 1,
  "referenceFiles": [],
  "upscale": "none",
  "outputDirectory": "C:\\projects\\my-remotion-video\\public\\generated\\flow",
  "download": true,
  "timeoutSeconds": 600,
  "confirmCreditSpend": true
}
```

For Remotion, files saved under `public/generated/flow` can be loaded with `staticFile("generated/flow/<file>.mp4")`.

## Upscaling

Upscaling is a real Flow asset action, not local interpolation:

1. The MCP opens the generated asset's context menu.
2. It reads factor or resolution choices structurally, independently of translated surrounding text.
3. It distinguishes previews, originals, available upscales, and disabled/upgrade-only choices.
4. Exact requests such as `2x` or `1080p` fail if that exact option is unavailable.
5. `highest_available` ranks only options Flow currently offers.
6. The MCP captures either the direct upscaled download or a newly processing asset.

The MCP never invents `4x`, silently downgrades a request, or substitutes an unrelated local upscaler.

## MCP tools

| Tool | Purpose | Spends credits |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| `flow_help` | Explain capabilities and concrete user request examples | No |
| `flow_list_accounts` | List locally configured account profiles | No |
| `flow_login_bridge_status` | Check the localhost login bridge | No |
| `flow_begin_account_connection` | Return exact extension instructions immediately, then stop | No |
| `flow_complete_account_connection` | Consume the user-sent session and verify Flow access | No |
| `flow_inspect_account` | Return the live normalized capability map | No |
| `flow_generate_video` | Generate, optionally upscale, and download video | Yes |
| `flow_generate_image` | Generate/edit and download an image | Potentially |
| `flow_job_status` | Poll a persistent job | No |
| `flow_upscale_video` | Request an exact live upscale option | Potentially |
| `flow_download_job` | Download an already-created asset | No new generation |

Every tool includes MCP-visible parameter descriptions so the agent knows how to use the live IDs returned by `flow_inspect_account`.

### If an agent opens or scrolls the public Flow website

That behavior is not a Flow MCP generation. Check the agent's tool trace: it must contain `flow_generate_video` or `flow_generate_image` and the response must contain a job ID. Version 0.2.0 adds a deterministic installer and non-blocking account onboarding in addition to the browser-fallback guard. Refresh or restart the MCP client after upgrading so it reloads the current server instructions and tool schemas.

If the MCP itself returns `flow_access_unavailable`, the selected Google identity is signed in but did not reach the Flow workspace. Restart the begin/complete connection workflow and select another account that has Flow access. Do not browse or scroll the landing page.

## Runtime data and diagnostics

Runtime state stays outside the repository by default:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\flow-mcp`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/flow-mcp`
- Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/flow-mcp` or `~/.local/share/flow-mcp`

```text
flow-mcp/
  accounts.json
  profiles/<account-id>/
  jobs/<job-id>.json
  diagnostics/*.png
```

Override the location with `FLOW_MCP_DATA_DIR`. Never commit that directory. If Flow changes its UI, errors include a diagnostic screenshot where possible; selectors intentionally prefer semantic roles and stable Material Symbols over translated text or hashed CSS classes.

## Security

- The login bridge binds only to `127.0.0.1` on a small fixed port range.
- Normal web origins are rejected; extension requests and cookie payloads are validated.
- Only Google-domain cookies are accepted.
- Session-transfer payloads are held in memory briefly and are never sent to a remote service by this project.
- Passwords and 2FA codes are never accessed.
- Generation and upscale tools require an explicit credit-spend confirmation argument.
- CAPTCHA, verification, regional restrictions, quotas, safety filters, and access controls are not bypassed.

The extension necessarily has powerful access to Google cookies. Install only a reviewed copy from this repository. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the threat model and responsible disclosure process.

## Project status

**Alpha.** The core workflow has been live-tested with an existing Chromium account, a Spanish Flow interface, live model/ratio/upscale discovery, one real Omni Flash generation, persistent polling, browser download capture, and FFprobe validation.

Google Flow does not provide a stable public browser-automation contract. UI changes can break selectors even with structural discovery and defensive failure behavior. Live Google-account tests are intentionally excluded from CI because they would require private sessions and spend credits.

Current priorities:

- Publish the login bridge through a browser extension store
- Split the large Flow adapter into smaller capability, generation, and asset modules
- Expand opt-in live tests for images, references, upscaling, and multiple accounts
- Add macOS/Linux onboarding helpers

## Development

```powershell
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run check
npm pack --dry-run
```
