# Changelog

All notable changes to Google Flow MCP are documented here.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- Every generation now persists Flow Agent's language-independent `AUTO_APPROVE` setting inside the isolated managed Chromium profile
- The MCP saves the preference, reopens Agent settings, and verifies that **Never ask before generating** actually persisted before submission
- If Flow still exposes an approval card, the MCP selects the final persistent **Approve and don't ask again** action instead of the one-time approval
- Individual asset `/edit/...` URLs are canonicalized back to their project workspace before generation so Agent settings are always reachable
- Agents are explicitly prohibited from handling Flow approval UI or asking users to interact with the hidden managed browser

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- Video readiness now verifies the exact generated media URL instead of requiring hidden Flow `<video>` elements to preload metadata
- Initial generation waits are bounded to 20 seconds; queued work returns a persistent `processing` job so later account operations are not blocked indefinitely
- Status polling finalizes downloads already authorized by the original generation request
- Original media downloads use the tracked asset URL directly, eliminating gallery visibility, ordering, localization, and context-menu failure modes
- Multiple MCP processes now reuse a shared per-account Chromium CDP session and coordinate account operations across Antigravity chats
- `flow_begin_account_connection` refuses unnecessary onboarding when a verified default account already exists
- Failed new account connections remove their temporary account record instead of accumulating misleading entries

### Agent contract

- A `processing` generation must be polled with the same job ID and must never be resubmitted merely because Flow queued it
- `flow_list_accounts` exposes explicit `readyForGeneration` and `connectionRequired` booleans

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- Replaced positional “last gallery item” downloads with exact per-job asset identity tracking
- Generation now snapshots pre-existing media, records only newly created asset identities, and carries them through status, upscale, and download operations
- Multi-output jobs wait for the requested number of new, ready assets instead of accepting the first count increase
- Missing or ambiguous asset identities fail closed instead of downloading an unrelated older asset
- Added regression tests for reordered galleries, durable URL matching, and ambiguous identity rejection

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Supported `npm run setup:antigravity` installer using Antigravity's official global stdio MCP config structure
- Hard installer contract in `AGENTS.md` and a complete numbered first-run guide in `INSTALL.md`
- `flow_help` for natural-language capability explanations and concrete request examples
- `flow_begin_account_connection`, which returns extension instructions immediately and forces the agent to stop for user action
- `flow_complete_account_connection`, which runs only after the extension session has been sent
- Bridge arming so the extension targets the MCP instance that requested account connection when multiple local clients are running
- Clean-install tests for config preservation, absolute stdio paths, scratch-directory refusal, and untouched browser configuration

### Changed

- Removed the blocking `flow_connect_account` tool to prevent agents from hiding a required extension click inside a five-minute tool call
- Flow Login Bridge now tells the user to return to the agent after the session is sent, before the temporary account chooser step
- Installer validation refuses modified tracked source and disposable Antigravity scratch clones
- Installer runs `npm ci`, all 25 tests, package dry-run validation, and normal system-browser detection before changing MCP config

### Installer rules

- No source patches during installation
- No `npx playwright install chromium`
- No generated MCP schema files
- No speculative browser flags or remote-debugging setup
- No replacement of unrelated MCP config entries

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed

- Added MCP initialization instructions that require agents to use `flow_*` tools exclusively and prohibit generic browser/computer-use fallback on the Flow website
- Distinguished an authenticated Google identity from an available Flow generation workspace
- Detects the public/marketing Flow page structurally and fails with `flow_access_unavailable` before searching, scrolling, or configuring generation controls
- Tracks `unverified`, `connected`, `needs_reconnect`, and `access_unavailable` account states
- Makes the most recently verified connection the default and prevents stale or unverified profiles from starting generation
- Allows account IDs to be omitted so agents use the verified default instead of guessing
- Added explicit agent next-action guidance to account and capability responses
- Added regression coverage for landing-page classification, verified defaults, unavailable accounts, MCP server instructions, and generation tool schemas
- Documented a stable Antigravity installation path so MCP entrypoints are not lost when its scratch directory is cleaned

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Local stdio MCP server with nine Flow tools
- Flow Login Bridge extension for reusing existing Chromium Google accounts
- Isolated persistent sessions and queues for multiple accounts
- Live, language-independent model, ratio, output-count, duration, and asset-option discovery
- Normalized IDs for Omni Flash, Veo, and Nano Banana model families
- Credit-confirmation gates for generation and upscaling
- Persistent generation jobs with status polling
- Structural detection of preview, original, available upscale, and unavailable/upgrade-only choices
- Browser download capture with `.flow.json` manifests, SHA-256, and optional FFprobe metadata
- Codex, Antigravity, generic MCP, and Remotion documentation
- Windows/Linux CI across Node.js 20 and 24

### Live validation

- Existing-account connection from normal Chromium
- Spanish-language Flow capability discovery
- Real Omni Flash 16:9 video generation
- Persistent queue polling and original-resolution video download
- H.264, duration, and resolution validation through FFprobe

### Known limitations

- Google Flow UI automation can require selector updates when the website changes
- Browser extension installation currently uses developer-mode “Load unpacked” setup
- Live image, reference-file, upscale-download, macOS/Linux browser, and multi-account concurrency paths need broader opt-in validation
